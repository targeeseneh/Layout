	<h1>CSS LAYOUT</h1>
	<div id="container">

		<div class="first">
			<h3>Layout: a brief history</h3>
			<p>
				In the early days of the web, designs more complex than a simple document were laid out with 'table' elements. Separating HTML from visual styles was made easier when CSS was widely adopted by browsers in the late '90s. CSS opened the door to developers being able to completely change the look and feel of a website without ever touching HTML. This new capability inspired projects such as <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/"> The CSS Zen Garden</a>, which was created to demonstrate the power of CSS to encourage more developers to learn it.

				CSS has evolved as our needs for web design and browser technology have evolved. You can read how CSS layout and our approach to layout has evolved over time in <a href="https://24ways.org/2019/a-history-of-css-through-15-years-of-24-ways/">this article by Rachel Andrew.</a>

			<h3>Understanding the display property </h3>
			<p>
				The display property does two things. The first thing it does is determine if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block. <br>
				Inline elements behave like words in a sentence. They sit next to each other in the inline direction. Elements such as 'span' and 'strong', which are typically used to style pieces of text within containing elements like a (paragraph), are inline by default. They also preserve surrounding whitespace. <br>
				You can't set an explicit width and height on inline elements. Any block level margin and padding will be ignored by the surrounding elements.
			</p>

			<p>
				Block elements don't sit alongside each other. They create a new line for themselves. Unless changed by other CSS code, a block element will expand to the size of the inline dimension, therefore spanning the full width in a horizontal writing mode. The margin on all sides of a block element will be respected.
			</p>
			<p>
				The display property also determines how an element's children should behave. For example, setting the display property to display: flex makes the box a block-level box, and also converts its children to flex items. This enables the flex properties that control alignment, ordering and flow.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="third">
			<h3>Flexbox and Grid</h3>
			<p>
				There are two main layout mechanisms that create layout rules for multiple elements,  <a href="https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/">flexbox</a> and <a href="https://web.dev/learn/css/grid/"> grid</a>. They share similarities, but are designed to solve different layout problems.
			</p>
			<h3>Flexbox </h5>
			<p>
				Flexbox is a layout mechanism for one-dimensional layouts. Layout across a single axis, either horizontally or vertically. By default, flexbox will align the element's children next to each other, in the inline direction, and stretch them in the block direction, so they're all the same height.
			</p>
			<p>
				Items will stay on the same axis and not wrap when they run out of space. Instead they will try to squash onto the same line as each other. This behaviour can be changed using the align-items, justify-content and flex-wrap properties. <br>
				Flexbox also converts the child elements to be flex items, which means you can write rules on how they behave inside a flex container. You can change alignment, order and justification on an individual item. You can also change how it shrinks or grows using the flex property. <br>
				The flex property is a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.
			</p>
			<h3>Grid </h5>
			<p>
				Grid is similar in a lot of ways to flexbox, but it is designed to control multi-axis layouts instead of single-axis layouts (vertical or horizontal space). <br>
				Grid enables you to write layout rules on an element that has display: grid, and introduces a few new primitives for layout styling, such as the repeat() and minmax() functions. One useful grid unit is the fr unitâ€”which is a fraction of remaining space.
			</p>
			<h3>Flow layout</h3>
			<p>
				If not using grid or flexbox, your elements display in normal flow. There are a number of layout methods that you can use to adjust the behavior and position of items when in normal flow.
			</p>
			<h3>Inline block</h3>
			<p>
				 surrounding elements don't respect block margin and padding on an inline element? With inline-block you can cause that to happen.Using inline-block gives you a box that has some of the characteristics of a block-level element, but still flows inline with the text.
			</p>
			<h3>Floats</h3>
			<p>
				The float property instructs an element to "float" to the direction specified. The image in this example is instructed to float left, which then allows sibling elements to "wrap" around it. You can instruct an element to float left, right or inherit.
			</p>
			<h3>Multicolumn layout</h3>
			<p>
				If you have a really long list of elements, such as a list of all of the countries of the world, it can result in a lot of scrolling and time wasted for a user. It can also create excess whitespace on the page. With CSS multicolumn, you can split this into multiple columns to help with both of these issues.
			</p>
			<h3>Positioning </h5>
			<p>
				The position property changes how an element behaves in the normal flow of the document, and how it relates to other elements. The available options are relative, absolute, fixed and sticky with the default value being static.
